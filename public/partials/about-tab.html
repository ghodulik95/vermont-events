        <h2>What is <span class="site-name-text"></span>?</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="site-name-text"></span> is a free community service run
          by Rutland local <strong>George Hodulik</strong>. It brings together
          community events from across Vermont into a single, easy-to-use
          calendar, map, and event listing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Event data is gathered through automated
          <strong>web scraping</strong> and
          <strong>ICS calendar integration</strong>. The backend uses
          <strong>Mobilizon</strong> to manage events and
          <strong>ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo</strong> to extract event details from
          source websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this process is automated, event details may sometimes be
          inaccurate or missing. We strongly recommend clicking through to the
          <strong>original event page</strong> to confirm the latest
          information. Events are updated approximately
          <strong>once a week</strong>, so last-minute changes may not be
          reflected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, <span class="site-name-text"></span> is likely to contain some
          duplicate events.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div id="panel9" class="about-panel" style="display: none">
        <h2>Publish an event</h2>
        <p>
          Publishing to <span class="site-name-text"></span> is easy. We use a
          <strong>Mobilizon</strong> backend, so all you have to do is create an
          account on our backend server: <span class="mobilizon-url"></span>.
          Public events will be added to the Vermont.Events calendar. Private
          events will only be accessible via link sharing.

        <h2>Welcome, Alpha Testers!</h2>
        <p>
          Thank you for being part of this early testing stage! Your help is
          essential to shaping this project into something truly useful and a
          pleasure to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, we’re in the Alpha Testing phase. This means the site is
          actively being developed and you may notice frequent changes. Some
          features or content may disappear or break temporarily. That’s
          expected! Our goal is to gather trusted feedback before moving to a
          more stable public Beta release.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we reach Beta, we’ll aim for a more reliable experience—like
          allowing users to create events and trust that they won’t vanish
          overnight. I also hope to expand coverage across Vermont, offering
          events that benefit folks from more regions, not just Rutland County.
        </p>
        <p>But to get there, I need your input!</p>
        <p>
          You can view the
          <a href="https://github.com/ghodulik95/vermont-events/issues"
            >current list of known issues here</a
          >
          and submit your own <a href="issue">using this form</a> or by clicking
          the "Submit an Issue" button at the top right. If your issue is about
          a specific event, please include the event title in your report.
          <br /><em
            >Note: Submissions are public and anonymous unless you include
            personal information. Please avoid sharing any personal details in
            the issue form.</em

          You’re also welcome to reach out directly by email at

        </p>

        <p>Here’s what I could especially use your help with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>More Testers:</strong> While this is not a public stage,
            please feel free to share the site with one or two trusted
            individuals who you believe will provide a useful perspective.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spreading the word:</strong> Feel free to show or discuss
            the site with others, and send feedback from conversations my way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Site Usability:</strong> What feels confusing or clunky to
            use?
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Site Appearance:</strong> What visual improvements or design
            tweaks do you suggest?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>About Section:</strong> Is the information here helpful and
            clear? I will do a rewrite soon, but in overall content, what is
            missing?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Event Accuracy:</strong> Are event categories, towns, dates,
            locations, and descriptions accurate? Much of this is automated, so
            spotting errors will help me improve the automation process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Event Sources:</strong> Any public website that regularly
            shares community events, please send them my way! Especially
            sites/shops/venues that you know off the top of your head-But also
            if you're able and willing to do a dedicated deep-dive search for
            pages, that would be great. Maybe we can schedule a virtual
            get-together to do this?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Event Creation Testing:</strong> Try making public or
            private events! Persistence isn’t guaranteed during Alpha, but your
            experiments help us improve for Beta.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organizer Workflow:</strong> If you run events already
            listed here, I’d love your help testing group ownership transfers or
            requests to opt out of aggregation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What’s new in 5/20 update?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Added some events from SevenDays</li>
          <li>Displaying multiple event source pages if applicable</li>
          <li>Support for showing multi-day events</li>
          <li>Fix 6-hour offset that was happening with some events</li>
          <li>Fixing some date inaccuracies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
        <p>
          I’d love to move into Beta Testing by June, ideally in time to share
          more local Pride events! Here are the main goals I’m working toward:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add 30 more event source sites, with at least 15 outside Rutland
            County
          </li>
          <li>
            Add at least 30 Facebook events (semi-manually, but totally doable!)
          </li>
          <li>
            Include all Front Porch Forum calendars (currently only one is
            included)
          </li>
          <li>
            Transition to a permanent Mobilizon backend at
            <code>mobilizon.vermont.events</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Test most site and backend features with users like you, and
            integrate your feedback
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop clear schedules for updating events, deploying changes, and
            checking data quality
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop a space where summaries of event scrapings/annotations are
            posted
          </li>
          <li>
            Fully open source the front-end site code, with easy-to-follow
            documentation
          </li>
          <li>
            Fully open source the event scraping code, also with great
            documentation
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Thank you again for testing and supporting this project. Your input
          makes all the difference!

        <h2>Using Filters</h2>
        <p>
          Use the search box, date pickers, town filter, and category filter to
          narrow down the event listings. Selecting “All” resets that filter.
          The calendar, map, and event cards will update automatically to
          reflect your selection.
        </p>
        <p>If the calendar or map appears empty, check the Event Cards.</p>
        <p>
          Note that some events do not have location information, so they do not
          appear on the map view. You can specifically see these events that are
          hidden from the map view by going to the Event Card view and toggling
          ' Hide events with location data'.
