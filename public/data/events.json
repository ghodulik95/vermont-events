    "description": "The VNA &amp; Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) offers a discussion group designed to address a topic many have difficulty talking about: death and dying.\n\nLed by Hospice volunteers, the objective of Death, Dying, &amp; Danishes is to increase awareness of death and to encourage people to make the most of their lives. Sharing food creates a relaxed and nurturing environment where the group can join open, honest conversations to explore the questions about life, dying and grief. People of all ages are encouraged to bring their questions, experiences, and thoughts to the gathering. The goal is simply to provide a forum for community members to come together in a relaxed atmosphere over coffee, tea, and goodies to share thought-provoking and life-affirming conversation.\n\nThe event is free and open to the public, but purchases are encouraged for host sites.\n\nThose looking for more information prior to attending can contact Mary Pleasant at 802.442.0540 or by emailing at <a href=\"http://mary.pleasant@vnahsr.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer ugc\">mary.pleasant@vnahsr.org</a>",

Spent.\n\nIn Alison Bechdel’s hilariously skewering and gloriously cast new comic novel confection, a cartoonist named Alison Bechdel, running a pygmy goat sanctuary in Vermont, is existentially irked by a climate-challenged world and a citizenry on the brink of civil war. She wonders: Can she pull humanity out of its death spiral by writing a scathingly self-critical memoir about her own greed and privilege?\n\nMeanwhile, Alison’s first graphic memoir about growing up with her father, a taxidermist who specialized in replicas of Victorian animal displays, has been adapted into a highly successful TV series. It’s a phenomenon that makes Alison, formerly on the cultural margins, the envy of her friend group (recognizable as characters, now middle-aged and living communally in Vermont, from Bechdel’s beloved comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For).\n\nAs the TV show Death and Taxidermy racks up Emmy after Emmy—and when Alison’s Pauline Bunyanesque partner Holly posts an instructional wood-chopping video that goes viral—Alison’s own envy spirals. Why couldn’t she be the writer for a critically lauded and wildly popular reality TV show…like Queer Eye...showing people how to free themselves from consumer capitalism and live a more ethical life?!!\n\nSpent’s rollicking and masterful denouement—making the case for seizing what’s true about life in the world at this moment, before it’s too late—once again proves that “nobody does it better” (New York Times Book Review) than the real Alison Bechdel.\n\nAlison Bechdel’s cult following for her early comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For expanded wildly for her family memoirs, the New York Times bestselling and Time magazine #1 Book of the Year graphic memoir Fun Home, adapted into a Tony Award–winning musical, and Are You My Mother? Most recently, The Secret to Superman Strength was named a New York Times Best Graphic Novel of 2021.
